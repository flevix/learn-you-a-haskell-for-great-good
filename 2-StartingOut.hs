-- Ranges

-- A handful of functions that produce infinite lists:
--
-- cycle takes a list and cycles it into an infinite list. If you just try to

--
-- repeat takes an element and produces an infinite list of just that element.
-- It's like cycling a list with only one element.
ten'ten = take 10 (repeat 10)
-- [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]

-- Although it's simpler to just use the replicate function if you want some

-- List comprehension
--
-- List comprehensions are very similar to set comprehensions. We'll stick to

--we want only the elements which, doubled, are greater than or equal to 12.

-- [12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40]

-- Tuples
--
-- In some ways, tuples are like lists â€” they are a way to store several values
-- into a single value.
--
-- ()
-- (1,2)
-- [(1,'a'),(8,'b'),(92,'z')]
--
-- Two useful functions that operate on pairs:
--
-- fst takes a pair and returns its first component.
fst1 = fst (8,11)
-- 8
fst2 = fst ("abc", 99)
-- "abc"
--
-- snd takes a pair and returns its second component. Surprise!
snd1 = snd (8,11)
-- 11
snd2 = snd ("abc", 99)
-- 99
--
-- zip. It takes two lists and then zips them together into one list by joining
-- the matching elements into pairs.
--
zip1 = zip [1,2,3,4,5] [5,5,5,5,5]
-- [(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,5)]
zip2 = zip [1..] ["apple", "orange", "cherry", "mango"]
-- [(1,"apple"),(2,"orange"),(3,"cherry"),(4,"mango")]
--
-- Example
-- Here's a problem that combines tuples and list comprehensions: which right
-- triangle that has integers for all sides and all sides equal to or smaller
-- than 10 has a perimeter of 24?
--
triangles = [(a,b,c) | c <- [1..10], b <- [1..c], a <- [1..b],
            a^2 + b^2 == c^2, a+b+c == 24]
